                <h5>Davis Model UN Conference</h5>
                <p>A few weeks ago, the team travelled to UC Davis over a weekend to compete in DMUNC! I represented the Republic of Poland in the First Committee, Disarmament and International Security Council. Our two topics were Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Weapon usage in Warfare and Private Military companies. Other than the conference itself, the weekend was filled with team bonding, including a trip to an ice cream shop where we visited d.tech alumni at UC Davis! While I didn't win any awards, it was a rewarding experience nonetheless. </p>
                <br>
                <h5>2019-2020 Team</h5>
                <p>I also had to complete my application for the 2019-20 team! In my application, I explained how the rising nationalistic sentiment in world governments poses the biggest threat to our world, as it erodes diplomatic pathways and renders international collaboration in world issues, such as Climate Change, obsolete. As I kind of expected - and hoped - I was admitted onto the team for my third year!</p>
                <br>
                <h5>2019-2020 Presidential Application</h5>
                <p>In addition to the general team application, I am in the midst of completing my application for president of the MUN team next year. I hope that I am either given the position of president of co-president, thought the latter seems more likely to me seeing as my competition has attended more conferences, won more awards, and held a higher position in the team than me.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Geography Curriculum</h5>
                <p>Lastly, I am working on crafting curriculum for the class next year focused around learning, understanding, and memorizing the geographic locations of countries around the world. </p>
